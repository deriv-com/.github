# Deriv.com

Welcome to the GitHub organization of Deriv.com's development team! We are dedicated to building high-quality, user-centric web interfaces that offer the best experience for our users. Our projects range from small libraries to large-scale web applications that we use for our global operations.

Our focus is on creating responsive, accessible, and visually stunning interfaces that meet user needs with simplicity and elegance.
